    <h1> Stroopwafel recipe</h1>
    <img src="stoopwafel.jpg" alt="Stroopwafel" > 
    <p> The Stroopwafel, a delightful treat from the Netherlands, is a culinary masterpiece that has won hearts around the globe. Its unique combination of textures and flavors sets it apart from other confections. The Stroopwafel consists of two thin, crisp waffle cookies sandwiching a sweet and sticky caramel filling. The contrast between the crunchy exterior and the gooey interior creates a delightful sensory experience with each bite. The waffles themselves are subtly flavored with a hint of cinnamon, adding a warm and spicy note that complements the sweetness of the caramel.
    </p>
    <p>What makes the Stroopwafel truly amazing, however, is its versatility. It can be enjoyed in many ways: straight from the package, warmed over a cup of coffee or tea, or even as an ingredient in gourmet desserts. When placed over a hot beverage, the steam gently warms the Stroopwafel, softening the caramel filling and releasing its aromatic flavors. This transforms the simple act of enjoying a Stroopwafel into a comforting ritual. Whether youâ€™re a fan of sweet treats or a foodie in search of unique flavors, the Stroopwafel is a must-try delicacy that promises to amaze.</p>
  
    <h4> ingredients </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>200 grams of Unsalted butter </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of Semi-skimmed milk</li>
        <li>7 grams of Dried yeast        </li>
        <li>250 grams of Wheat flour        </li>
        <li>80 grams of White caster sugar </li>
        <li> 2 Pinches of salt        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4> steps </h4>
    <ol> 
        <li>Prepare the stroopwafel dough: In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer, combine the flour, yeast, cinnamon and sugar1. Next, use a pastry blender to cut in the pieces of butter. Continue to work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles small coarse crumbs. </li>
        <li> Preheat the waffle iron: Preheat the waffle iron for 45-60 seconds, or until steam from the iron has dissipated.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling: Heat the butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan together. After adding the cinnamon and maple syrup, reduce the heat to low and let it soak for a few minutes. </li>
        <li> Bake the waffles: Once the waffles have fallen off the hot iron, it is best to slice them as soon as they come off the iron.</li>
        <li> Assemble the stroopwafel: The two wafers are placed on top of each other, with the filling in between. They are then pressed together and cut into individual cookies. </li>
    </ol>
